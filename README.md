# Easy User Authentication for React Apps

This repository hosts a React project that defines a Single-Page Application (SPA). You'll secure access to some of its routes using Auth0 User Authentication.

## Get Started

Install the client project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the client project:

```bash
npm start
```

The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.

Visit [`http://localhost:4040/`](http://localhost:4040/) to access the starter application.
