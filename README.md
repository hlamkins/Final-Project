# Easy User Authentication for React Apps

This repository hosts a React project that defines a Single-Page Application (SPA). You'll secure access to some of its routes using Auth0 User Authentication.

## Get Started

Install the client project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
````

Run the client project:

```bash
npm start
```

The application runs by on port `4040` to mitigate conflicting with other client applications you may be running.

Visit [`https://github.com/hlamkins/Final-Project`](https://github.com/hlamkins/Final-Project) to access the starter application.
